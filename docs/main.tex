\begin{abstract}
The Rubik's cube is both a very popular toy and an interesting mathematical problem. Many algorithms have already been developed to provide an efficient way of calculating the solution, one of them being the family of evolutionary strategies. Herdy's algorithm is a very interesting member of this family, because of its simplicity and good performance. In this paper we try to present this approach and propose a few different enhancements to this algorithm. We also provide test results in order to illustrate the influence of our enhancements.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem}

The Rubik’s cube has been a subject of scientific research for many years since its invention by Erno Rubik. It is a discrete combinatorial optimisation problem with a solution space of \(4.3*10^{19}\)different configurations, which makes it a non trivial game.

The point of the game is to arrange properly a coloured cube, so that each side (further on called face) is composed of small squares (facelets) in a single colour. The player is able to rotate each face either clockwise or counterclockwise in order to descramble the cube.
Usually the best solution is the one made quickest, but some variations of the game reward shortest solutions in favor of the complicated ones.

\subsection{Cube structure}
The classic \(3^3\) cube consists of  26 pieces: 8 corner pieces, 12 edge pieces and 6 center pieces. As previously mentioned, each side of a cube will be called face and each face is composed of 9 single-coloured facelets. The name cubie is introduced to denote a physical object, which can have 1 (middle cubie), 2 (edge cubie) or 3 (corner) visible facelets. The classic Rubik’s cube is composed of 26 such cubies.

Each face can be rotated clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) thereby changing the position of its facelets. However, the facelet at the centre cannot be moved by any possible and legal rotation, thus determining the colour of a solved face.

In fact the middle row can be physically rotated, but such move is equivalent to rotating two surrounding faces in the opposite direction, hence the mutual location of the facelets in the centres is pre-determined.

For every corner and edge piece it is of great importance to distinguish between its position and orientation: i.e. an edge can be in a right position (defined by the two adjacent center colours), but in the wrong orientation.

\subsection{Notation}
There are 12 possible rotations at each point of the game - a clockwise and counterclockwise for each of the faces. To distinguish between them we will use a standard notation consisting of \textit{F, R, U, B, L, D}  which stand for front, right, up, back, left, down clockwise turn respectively and \textit{Fi, Ri, Ui, Bi, Li, Di} accordingly for the counterclockwise rotations. Therefore a single move can be described as one letter and a sequence by a string such as \textit{FBiDURi}.

We can also distinguish half-turns (\textit{F2, R2, U2, B2, L2, D2}), which are achieved by two consecutive quarter-turns, but are often perceived as a single move.

To complete this description, we should also mention the colours. Various implementations may differ, but we will use a fairly standard configuration: i.e. \textit{F = white, R = red, U = blue, B = yellow, L = orange, D = green}. 

\section{Original Herdy's algorithm}
\subsection{Individual representation}
An individual is represented by a list of rotations and a cube state. This state is equivalent to the initial problem tackled with the rotations from the list. To store the cube 6 two-dimensional (3x3) matrices are used.

\subsection{Mutation}
Although mutations that change the color of only a single facelet would be suitable for evolutionary algorithm, since they introduce steady change of fitness, they would yield non-existent cube states.

We could thread any valid single move, such as, for instance, Fi, as a mutation, but it would introduce too abrupt changes in fitness value.

It just so happens that it’s more effective in terms of evolutionary algorithm to thread sequences of multiple moves, well-known to cube solvers, which interchange the position of just few, say, 2 cubies, or rotate a single cubie.

Unfortunately these sequences comprise of multiple moves, yielding very long solutions from scrambled for solved cube. We sacrifice the length of final solution for the simplicity of the algorithm.

The sequences (mutations) are presented in the table \ref{table:mutations}

\begin{table}[h]

\hline
three inslice edge swap CW & RLiU2RiLF2 & 6 \\
\hline
three inslice edge swap CCW & LiRU2LRiF2 & 6 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This table does not include “mirrors” of the listed sequences.
To take mirrors into account when performing a new mutation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The face of the cube for which the sequence will be applied is chosen randomly (6 possibilities).
\item Next, the orientation of the cube is chosen (4 possibilities, each achieved by rotating the whole cube 0, 1, 2, or 3 quarter-turns clockwise).
\end{enumerate}
Altogether we have \(12*6*4 = 288\) possible mutations

\subsection{Fitness calculation}
Three qualities q1, q2, q3 are defined:
\begin{itemize}
\item q1 is increased by 1 for each facelet whose color differs from the center facelet on the same face
\item q2 is increased by 4 for each wrong positioned edge, orientation is not considered
\item q3 is increased by 6 for each wrong positioned corner, orientation is not considered
\end{itemize}
Fitness is a sum of those 3 components. The lower the fitness = the better. Solved cube has fitness 0.

\subsection{Selection}
The original Herdy’s algorithm does not enforce any type of selection, but suggests that a simple elitist selection should yield best results. This type of selection consists of two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sorting the whole population by the fitness value
\item Choosing  best individuals (with the smallest fitness)
\end{enumerate}

This kind of selection guarantees preserving the best individuals, but has a negative impact on population diversity.

\section{Implemented enhancements}
We propose two enhancements to the described algorithm. The first is a little more complex tournament selection described in the subchapter below and the second one is an attempt to shrink developed solutions, which can be very long.

For all enhancements appropriate tests have been performed with the results presented after each subchapter.

\subsection{Tournament selection}
This kind of selection is slightly more complex than a basic elitist selection. It consists of three basic steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Divide population into random several equally large groups
\item Choose the best individual in each group in terms of fitness value
\item Create a new population composed of these chosen individuals
\end{enumerate}

The strategy guarantees preserving the best individual for the whole population, but the other (second best, third best etc.) champions may not be chosen for the subsequent generation.
However, this method in certain circumstances enables the selection of worse individuals, which improves population diversity and may have a positive impact on the convergence speed.
This selection strategy also does not involve sorting and may perform better in terms of pure calculation speed.

\subsection{Solution reduction}
The other enhancement is an attempt to reduce the length of possible solutions. After each mutation an additional sequence is concatenated to the previous result yielding very long strings after certain period of time.

The idea is to... \todo{TODO}

\section{Test results}
\subsection{Parameters}
Basic parameters describing an evolutionary strategy are $(\mu, \lambda)$. The former defines the number of parents i.e. individuals selected from a population to give birth to another generation, while the latter parameter denotes offspring, that is the number of individuals generated from the previous population (parents).

During various tests run for the purpose of the experiment, we have empirically established a range of values, where the performance of the algorithm is the best. The program generally yielded better results for smaller values of $(\mu, \lambda)$, therefore we decided to take advantage of these observations to run our tests.

In order to ensure the lack of correlation between a specific combination of $(\mu, \lambda)$ and our results, we took  $(\mu, \lambda) = \{(x,y) : x \in \{10, 20, 50\} \wedge y \in \{100, 200, 500\}\}$. This also enables us to compare the influence of the parameters on the performance.

The same tests have been run twice on different computers, using different measuring techniques. This restricts our ability to draw conclusions from absolute numbers, however we are still able to compare relative values.

\subsection{Tournament selection}

Tests have been carried out to determine the behaviour of the algorithm, depending on the chosen selection type and $(\mu, \lambda)$. Moreover two different measuring techniques were used.

The algorithm tends to occasionally get stuck on one fitness value and further computations (no matter how long) do not improve the final result, forcing the program to end computations after a fixed amount of generations. In order to overcome this obvious drawback and learn about its relation to the selection methods, we have chosen to implement two ways of time measurement.

First method measures only the \textit{valid} runs i.e. the ones, when the algorithm has been successful in solving the cube and ended correctly. This approach however ignores all the executions, where the program was unable to solve the problem and these can vary depending on our selection method. Therefore another time measurement technique has been introduced, this time also including the \textit{invalid} runs i.e. the ones where the cube has not been solved and the program has been forced to end further computations. These tests have been run also on different machines, thus will be presented and discussed separately.

First method yielded results presented in tables \ref{table:valid_elitist_tests} and \ref{table:valid_tournament_tests}.

The results clearly indicate a better performance for the elitist selection algorithm both in terms of time and the amount of generations. The numbers however include only the 
\textit{valid} runs, discarding the cubes impossible for the algorithm to solve.

The results including all executions are presented in tables \ref{table:invalid_elitist_tests} and \ref{table:invalid_tournament_tests}.

These numbers, on the other hand, show a better result of the tournament selection in terms of time, but favor elitist method regarding the number of generations needed to solve the cube. This might be expected, because the elitist method involves sorting and is therefore slightly slower, but the results differ widely from the previous tests.

This is probably due the difference in the measurement method and is more thoroughly discussed at the end of the paper. Elitist selection seems to be more vulnerable to the possibility of getting stuck and statistically is unable to solve a cube much more often. This is why it is slower when counting all executions, but shines when counting just the valid ones.

The tournament selection however does not perform better in solving the cube, but is less likely to get stuck during the computation and gives better results when counting all executions. The attempt to explain this phenomenon can be found in the final section of the article.

\section{Conclusions}

The purpose of this study was to implement and possibly enhance the original Herdy's algorithm for solving the Rubik's cube. Ideas proposed in this paper involve applying a tournament selection method and a module responsible for the reduction of possible solutions. The performance of proposed enhancements has been tested and the results have been presented.

Tests analyzing the performance of various methods of selection have been carried out on two machines and using two different measuring approaches. In the first case only the valid runs have been taken into account, while the second method measured all of the executions, including the ones which have timed out. Results indicated, that the tournament selection is much more immune to becoming halted by an unfortunate cube configuration, however it is outperformed in the case when only valid runs are considered. It is also slightly faster in terms of pure speed (time needed to increment the population, not the fitness convergence) due to its lack of sorting.

This phenomenon might be caused by the variety of population, which seems to be smothered by the elitist selection. By selecting only the narrow group of global champions in each generation, the population quickly becomes very homogenous and it is more and more difficult to create a solution varying significantly from the others. Tournament selection on the other hand enables occasional advancements of weaker individuals, which can outperform the rest of the population in future generations. This ability makes also the algorithm less vulnerable to becoming halted by an unfortunate cube configuration.

Further study of the topic might include examining the population diversity in each selection method or developing more advanced algorithms for the reduction of long solutions.
